Week 1

My team formed with the team name Newbie Squad, I created a new Jira project to invite all the team members and the lecturer
to join in. After the discussion with our team, we decided to develop a Car Space Renting System as our project.
We also discussed the technical background of each member and the requirements of the project to find out which web framework
is suitable for us to deploy the development. We had a preliminary background review of the related existing systems to come up
with some ideas of what functionalities we want to implement.

Week 2

We wrote a draft list of all the main functionalities that I update it to the Jira meeting note. 2 team members will do the
backend development using Flask framework and the rest 3(including myself) will do the frontend using React framework.
